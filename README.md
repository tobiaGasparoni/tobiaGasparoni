### I have experience as a full stack engineer with the following technologies:

Rest APIs Design | Web Development | Firebase | Kotlin | Python | Django | TypeScript | Microservices |

### Repositories explained:

1. **MaaS-Thesis**: this was the final project for my undergraduate journey (related paper: https://repositorio.uniandes.edu.co/handle/1992/59062?show=full). It aimed at being a Model as a Service, a companion tool for consulting firms with optmization models, and related algorithms, as their product. It was created using Django (Python) with a modified file structure that personally guaranteed functional flexibility and scalabilty. In current iterations of the project, you will find this as the main repository for algorithms and optimization models I find interesting enough to study, develop and test.

2. **Supermarket backend simulator**: purely a portfolio project, this is a backend that demonstrates how I handle complex database design and changes in the specifications of a project. That's possible because I am basing this on my Transactional Systems class project, this just being from a different semester than the one where I saw it. I also intend to document every change committed to build the each stage of the project, which shows off my technical writing abilities.
