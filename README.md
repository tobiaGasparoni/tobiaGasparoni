### I have experience as a full stack engineer with the following technologies:

Rest APIs Design | Web Development | Firebase | Kotlin | Python | Django | TypeScript | Microservices |

### Repositories explained:

1. **Supermarket backend simulator**: a backend accessible through a REST API that demonstrates complex database design abilities, as well as changes in the specifications of a project. I am basing this on my Transactional Systems class project, this just being from a different semester than the one where I studied it. I also intend to document every change committed to build each stage of the project (3 main stages). Tech stack: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and Docker.


2. **Model-as-a-Service**: project that allows companies to easily create, customize, and execute their own optimization models, among other algorithms. Because of its inherent complexity, this is a program based on microservices, grouped in a monorepo. It will involve several languages like Python for designing the optimization models, Go for more infrastructure-oriented code (feature flags, authentication), and Typescript for client-side code (REST APIs and GUIs in React).
